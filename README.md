## Self-Introduction – Hussam Ibrahim

#### Dear Doctor,

I hope you're doing well.

<p>My name is Hussam Ibrahim, I’m a student in the Software Engineering program.<br> I’m currently taking your course, and I wanted to briefly introduce myself.</p>



I’m **24** years old, and I’m passionate about learning and building real-world projects. At the moment, I’m actively studying **JavaScript**  as part of my journey to become a **full-stack developer**.<br> I’m excited to deepen my skills through this course and apply what I learn to future projects.



<em>Thank you for your time, and I look forward to learning from you this semester</em>.



Best regards,<br>
<strong>_Hussam Ibrahim_</strong>
